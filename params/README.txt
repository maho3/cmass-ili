This folder contains lists of cosmological parameters in a latin hypercube. 

The parameters are stored as plain text columns of (Omega_m, Omega_b, h, n_s, sigma_8). 

These are designed to standardize our cosmological suites, but can be altered according to individual usages.

Currently, they are the same as the Quijote latin hypercube and Sobol sequence cosmologies.
