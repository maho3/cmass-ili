# whether to use abundance matching to affix number density

galaxy_density: null  # number density in h^3/Mpc^3. null for no abundance matching
galaxy_proxy: null  # property for abundance matching (null for no abundance matching)

# Note, we don't have a mass proxy for galaxies, so we can't use abundance matching
